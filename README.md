## NLW Journey Java Track - Travel Manager

### Scope
A person should be able to organize their own trips and share them with their friends or family.

### Technologies
- H2 Memory (in-memory database to simplify learning; I am considering migrating to a conventional relational database later)
- Flyway (migration manager)
- Lombok (generates boilerplate code through annotations, improving Java development experience)
- JPA (facilitates best practices for database persistence)
